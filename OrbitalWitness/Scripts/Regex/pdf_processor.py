# Explanation:
# 1. The read_and_process_pdf method reads the PDF file using PyMuPDF, which provides robust support for PDF manipulation.
# 2. The method iterates through each page of the PDF and searches for the keyword 'title' using a regular expression.
#    This ensures that we process only relevant sections of the text.
# 3. Extracted text between 'title' and 'Title' is appended to the data, with the keyword 'title' removed.
#    This helps in cleaning the extracted text and retaining the relevant information.
# 4. Double newlines are replaced with a single newline to maintain a clean format.

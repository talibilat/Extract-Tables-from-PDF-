# Explanation:
# 1. The get_elements method extracts elements from a specified file using the UnstructuredClient.
#    This method handles reading the file, setting the request parameters, and making the request.
# 2. The method opens the file in binary read mode, which is necessary for reading non-text files like PDFs.
# 3. The request parameters are set to use a high-resolution strategy with the YOLOX model for accurate extraction.
# 4. The try-except block handles any SDK errors that might occur during the request, ensuring that the method can gracefully handle exceptions.
# 5. The response elements are converted to a usable format using dict_to_elements, which ensures that the data can be easily processed and used.
